# Moo card codes

Moo is a cracking service for printing your own business cards. They let
you print as few as 100 cards at a time, and you can upload a unique
image for each card.

You can take advantage of this to put discount codes for your product on
your business card - you just need a quick way to turn a bunch of
invitation codes into images that you can upload to Moo!

That's what this script is for. It uses GraphicsMagick.

For instructions (and an example) see this blog post:
